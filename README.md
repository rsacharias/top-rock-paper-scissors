# top-rock-paper-scissors

The purpose of this project is to recapitulate basic JavaScript concepts which were teached in the curriculum of The Odin Project (TOP) up to this point. This includes variables and functions in particular. Goal is to build an application from scratch, in this case, the well known game: *Rock, Paper, Scissors*.
